1. If you will be using the default PeerRTC backend server provided by us for testing purposes, you can skip this step. For own
managed backend server, refer to [PeerRTC server's](https://github.com/PeerRTC/PeerRTC-Server) repository. Server owned by us is unstable and not managed so it is
recommended to host your own. <br/><br/>

2. Add the following in your root [build.gradle](https://github.com/PeerRTC/AndroidPeerRTC/blob/master/build.gradle) file. <br/>
```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

3. Add in [build.gradle](https://github.com/PeerRTC/AndroidPeerRTC/blob/master/app/build.gradle) (app level) file. <br/>
```
dependencies {
 implementation 'com.github.PeerRTC:AndroidPeerRTC:v.1.0.1-beta'
}
```
