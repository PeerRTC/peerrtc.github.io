1. If you will be using the default PeerRTC backend server provided by us for testing purposes, you can skip this step. For own
managed backend server, refer to [PeerRTC server's](https://github.com/PeerRTC/PeerRTC-Server) repository. Server owned by us is unstable and not managed so it is
recommended to host your own.<br/><br/>

2. Add PeerRTC module in your html project's body.<br/>

```
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://PeerRTC.github.io/PeerRTC/peer.js"></script>
```


3. Initialize the PeerRTC class in your main or index javascript file. <br/>
 
  ```
    peer = new PeerRTC()
  ```
  
4. Connect to the backend server. <br/>
```
  onConnect = p=>{
    // Code after successful connection to the server goes here
    myId = p.id 
    console.log("Successfully connected to the server")
    console.log("My Id: " + myId)
  }

  // true will only work if your server's url is SSL supported.
  isSecure = true
  
  // connect to the server
  peer.start(isSecure, onConnect)
```
